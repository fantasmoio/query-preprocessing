# Lighting Robustness
## Python Template Project for Auto Gamma Correction

This project is a template to be converted to mobile.

## Overview
The image enhancement aims to increase the mean brightness of query images to a 
minimum level. Brightness is enhanced using gamma correction. The core routine of
this project computes the gamma parameter necessary to lift the brightness to a
predefined minimum value B_min.
Images with mean brightness above B_min are not processed and therefore left unchanged.
